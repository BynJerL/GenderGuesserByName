# ML Project: Name Gender Predictor (CLI)
![display](display.png)

## Overview
This project aims to classify names based on gender. The goal is to predict the correct gender from a given name. It is a lighthearted, _just-for-fun_ project designed to gain hands-on experience with Keras.

## Features
- **CLI Program**: Users can input a name (particularly the first name) and receive the predicted gender directly in the terminal.
- **Multiple Inputs**: Users can test multiple names in a continuous loop. Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

## Tools used
[![Used Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,tensorflow)](https://skillicons.dev)
- **Python 3.11**: Programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and development.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Machine learning framework.
- **Scikit-learn (SkLearn)**: For preprocessing and metrics.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Future Improvement
- Refactor and tidy up the code for better readability.
- Enhance the display for a more user-friendly experience.
- Work on improving the model's accuracy.
